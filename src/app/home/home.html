        Jason and Maddie met on their very first day of classes at Miami University on August 27, 2017, when they began their undergraduate studies &mdash; Jason majoring in Psychology and Biology, and Maddie in Psychology and Philosophy. What started as a friendship formed on day one quickly became something more. They became inseparable almost immediately, and as Jason&rsquo;s sister Haleigh later put it, <em>&ldquo;We knew there was something special when Jason came home for their first fall break and couldn&rsquo;t think of a single story that Maddie wasn&rsquo;t a part of.&rdquo;</em>
      </p>

      <p class="our-story-body-text">
        Their college years were full of morning coffee dates, game nights, and long walks around campus together, all while growing, learning, and building a life surrounded by an incredible group of friends. Many of those friendships turned into lifelong partnerships, creating what Miami alumni affectionately call “Miami Mergers,” a term used for couples who met at Miami and later married. Jason and Maddie feel lucky to now be joining a group that already includes so many of their closest friends.
      </p>

      <p class="our-story-body-text">
        After graduating from Miami in 2021, their days shifted from campus walks to building a life together in Columbus. Maddie began law school, and Jason started his career at The Ohio State University, helping run the marketing research lab. In 2023, they welcomed Roo, their beloved golden retriever, who quickly became the heart of their home. Maddie finished law school in 2024 and, after passing the bar exam, began her legal career at FBT Gibbons in October 2024.
      </p>

      <p class="our-story-body-text">
        In May 2025, Jason and Maddie bought their first home together in Victorian Village, where they still love their long walks with Roo around the neighborhood, walking to Ohio State football games, Blue Jackets hockey games, and Crew soccer matches. Just one month later, in June 2025, Jason proposed in the backyard of that very home, turning the place where they were building their future into the place where the next chapter officially began.
      </p>

      <p class="our-story-body-text">
        Now, as they count down the days to May 22nd, Jason and Maddie cannot wait to get married and share their wedding day with the people who have loved, supported, and celebrated them every step of the way.
